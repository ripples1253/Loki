# Loki - The simple server management system for Minecraft!

Loki, the norse god of mischeif and chaos; and also a Minecraft project!

Loki aims to make managing a Bungeecord server simple, with automatic server registration and a simple API.

## There are 3 components to Loki:
- spigot-server-microservice: Handles server-to-server communication.
- loki-bungee: Handles spigot server registration on your Bungeecord Proxy.
- loki-spigot: Sends server information to the spigot microservice and handles announcements.

## No support is provided!
If you'd like support with my projects, I'm more than happy to join your team as a developer or systems administrator!

However, I will not provide support to random people who don't know much about Spigot or operating a Network, mostly because if this is you:
Trust me, you won't need a system like this for quite a while. By the time you'd require a system like Loki, you'd understand how to set it up and use the system effectively.

Loki is best used with a Docker orchestration service (hey, maybe Kubernetes if you're fancy!); However, it is not required to use the software.
